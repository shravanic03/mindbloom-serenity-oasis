                <p>
                  PMHS began in 2019 when our founder, Dr. Emma Wilson,
                  recognized that despite growing awareness of mental health
                  issues, many people still struggled to find accessible
                  resources and support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having worked as a clinical psychologist for over a decade,
                  Dr. Wilson saw firsthand how the right guidance, community
                  support, and educational resources could transform people's
                  mental health journeys. She envisioned a platform that would
                  combine these elements in an approachable, stigma-free digital
                  environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, PMHS has grown into a comprehensive mental wellness
                  platform serving thousands of users worldwide. Our team of
                  mental health professionals, content creators, and technology
                  specialists work together to provide evidence-based resources
                  in an engaging, accessible format.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that mental health care should be personalized,
                  proactive, and integrated into everyday life. Through PMHS,
                  we're working to make that vision a reality for people
                  everywhere.
