                <p>
                  Reading can be more than just a pleasant pastime. Research has
                  shown that regular reading can reduce stress, improve
                  cognitive function, and even increase empathy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When we read about characters facing challenges similar to our
                  own, we can gain new perspectives and feel less alone.
                  Self-help and psychology books can provide practical tools and
                  frameworks for understanding and managing our mental health.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We recommend setting aside just 15-30 minutes each day for
                  reading. Choose books that resonate with your current
                  experiences or interests, and don't be afraid to put down a
                  book that isn't serving you.
